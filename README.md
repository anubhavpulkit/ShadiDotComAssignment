## Tech
- Swift - Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc.
- SwiftUI - An innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift!
- SDWebImageSwiftUI - SDWebImageSwiftUI is a SwiftUI wrapper for the SDWebImage library, which is used to handle image downloading and caching efficiently in iOS apps.
- CoreData - Core Data is a framework provided by Apple that enables you to manage the model layer of an application in a more structured and efficient way. 
- Combine - Combine is a framework introduced by Apple which provides a declarative Swift API for processing asynchronous events and managing data streams.

## Design Pattern Used:

- MVVM - The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern separates an application into three core components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic. </br>
View: Displays the data and handles user interactions.  </br>
ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary, exposing data from the model to the view and handling user input by updating the model.  </br> 

> This separation promotes a clean structure, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
  
## Requirements
- iOS 17.2 +
- For the best UI choose `light mode`
